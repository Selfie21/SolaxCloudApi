Hello user!

With this skill you can easily connect your Solax Farm to your alexa in order to retrieve information easily via voice command. 
In order to get information you can prompt the Skill via:

_Open **Solax Cloud**_

After the first call the Skill will prompt you to add your API token and Site Identification, in order to retrieve your data. Pictures of where to find both information
can be found below. After opening the Skill you have to enter both via:

_Token Id **{token id}** Site Id **{site id}**_

I highly recommend entering this data via the App Interface of your Alexa App on your phone and copy and pasting the command see [Type to Alexa by Text](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GBUJQF9ZX3TV7MK6). This data only has to be entered once. After that the command to launch the skill tells you your information after that.
Other ways to trigger the information again are via:

_**Solax Cloud**_

_**Information**_

_**Yield**_

Output information is total yield today, total yield overall and battery power.

I am not associated with Solax Cloud in any way, this merely provides an interface for using their service and I am not making any money with this Skill.
