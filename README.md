# SolaxCloudApi
Has different functionalities most importantly getting the data from the Solax Cloud Portal.

Don't call the API to often, since it will get slowed down significantly. This isn't really a good way to access the Cloud anyway. Im still working on a better solutions, but if you have nothing I guess this works.

If you want more information you can check out more POST requests on the site or look at the yield_data json file.
